NAME
    Starlet

SYNOPSIS
      % start_server --port=80 -- plackup -s Starlet [options] your-app.psgi

      or if you do not need hot deploy,

      % plackup -s Starlet --port=80 [options] your-app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    Starlet is a standalone HTTP/1.0 server formerly known as
    Plack::Server::Standalone::Prefork and
    Plack::Server::Standalone::Prefork::Server::Starter.

    The server supports following features, and is suitable for running HTTP
    application servers behind a reverse proxy.

    - prefork and graceful shutdown using Parallel::Prefork

    - hot deploy using Server::Starter

    - fast HTTP processing using HTTP::Parser::XS (optional)

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
    In addition to the options supported by plackup, Starlet accepts
    following options(s).

  --max-workers=#
    number of worker processes (default: 10)

  --timeout=#
    seconds until timeout (default: 300)

  --keepalive-timeout=#
    timeout for persistent connections (default: 2)

  --max-keepalive-reqs=#
    max. number of requests allowed per single persistent connection. If set
    to one, persistent connections are disabled (default: 1)

  --max-reqs-per-child=#
    max. number of requests to be handled before a worker process exits
    (default: 100)

NOTES
    If you are looking for a standalone preforking HTTP server, then you
    should really look at Starman. However if your all want is a simple HTTP
    server that runs behind a reverse proxy, this good old module still does
    what it used to.
